# CmdStarter

This library is a layer over [System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api) to ease integration 
into existing projects. Currently, this dependency is still in beta version, hence this library's version will stay 
in beta too.

## Features
- Implement commands using an abstract class or an interface
- Filter classes to use in current execution by namespaces or by full class names
- Classes using dependency injection are supported
- Mark classes as global options container
- Easy access to the global options inside the executing method
- Lonely command can be rooted
- Autowiring properties to System.CommandLine command options
- Autowiring executing method parameters to System.CommandLine command arguments
- Alias, Hidden, Description and AutoComplete attributes are offered to set command options/arguments properties
- Automatic commands tree loading via namespaces or Parent|Children attributes

## Usage

- Import the [nuget package **cints.CmdStarter**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/cints.CmdStarter). 
  > Ensure to check *Prerelease* checkbox
- Command integration (Choose one):
  - Create a new class inheriting from `StarterCommand`.
  - Add `IStarterCommand` interface to an existing class having a constructor without parameter.
     > For dependency injection, see below.
- Create the Program class below.

```
internal class Program
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var starter = new CmdStarter.Lib.Starter();
        await starter.Start(args);
    }
}
```

### Dependency injection

Those methods allow classes with a constructor having parameters.
- `IStarterCommand.GetInstance` method can be overridden
- `Starter.SetFactory` can be used to change the default behavior of instantiation
- `(new Starter()).Start(IServiceManager, string[])` can be used having an object implementing `IServiceManager`

Any of your preferred library can be used. This repository includes an example with Simple Injector.
